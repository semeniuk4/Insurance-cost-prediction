Health Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning and Data Science methods
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is predict the charge of insurance. 

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Jupyter notebook
* HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

## Project Description
The machine learning model was created with sklearn and linear regression using the Health Insurance Cost dataset from kaggle.com. Second step is a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter age, sex , height etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price of the insurance.
